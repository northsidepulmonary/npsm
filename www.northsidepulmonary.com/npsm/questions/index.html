<p><h4>Q: How much time should I plan for my appointment?</h4>
A: The length of time of your appointment depends on a few factors<br />
<ul>
<li>Whether you are a new patient or established patient
<li>The state of your health and whether you have other illnesses
<li>Whether certain tests need to be conducted
</ul>
We recommend that new patients budget atleast 2 hours and established patients budget an hour.<br /></p>

<p><h4>Q: How long does it take to get test results? </h4>
A: The time between conduct of the test and receipt by our office of the
results varies by test. Most results are delivered within 2-3 working days (Results for tests done on Wednesday/Thursday are normally delivered by close on Monday).
However samples for certain tests need to be sent out of state and for
these it might take upto 7 days before results are known.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you return for your follow up visit, your test results will be reviewed by your physician with you. Our practice staff will not discuss test results over the phone.<br /></p>

<p><h4>Q: How long does it take for medication refills?</h4>
A: Refills are generally called in within 24-72 hours. Please do not wait
until you are completely out of a medication prior to calling for
refill.</p>

<p><h4>Q: Will my sleep study be performed on the same day as my appointment?</h4>
A: The sleep study is an over night test that&nbsp;will
be &nbsp;performed in the Sleep Lab. You will receive a call from the sleep lab to schedule
this appointment.</p>

<p><h4>Q: Do you accept my insurance?</h4>
A: We accept most insurance.&nbsp; However, it your responsibility to check with your insurance company to confirm coverage and benefits. Please be sure to bring your insurance card with you every time you visit us. Please also notify our office whenever your insurance coverage changes so that our staff can maintain accurate medical records.  </div><br /></p>
